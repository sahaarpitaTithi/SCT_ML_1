# SCT_ML_1
# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a linear regression model to predict the price of houses based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The project is built using Python and the `scikit-learn` library.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model for predicting house prices. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable (house price) and one or more independent variables (square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of the following columns:
- `SquareFootage`: The size of the house in square feet.
- `Bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms in the house.
- `Bathrooms`: The number of bathrooms in the house.
- `Price`: The price of the house.

For demonstration purposes, a sample dataset is included in the code.

## Installation
To run this project,is need to have Python installed on machine along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

  
  ## Usage
git clone https://github.com/sahaarpitaTithi/SCT_ML_1.git


##  Model Evaluation
The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using the following metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted house prices.
R-squared Score: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.


## Visualization
A scatter plot of the actual vs. predicted house prices is generated to visually assess the model's performance.
